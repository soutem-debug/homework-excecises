tup = "Hello"
print(len(tup))
# There is no trailing comma in this code so the python looks at it as string and returns
# the length of that string - ie 5 letters


tup = "Hello",
print(len(tup))

# This code has a trailing comma so python interprets it as a tuple and returns
# how many items are in it.
